MACHINE LEARNING:
Supervised: Classification, Regression
Unsupervied: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

Neural network/deep learning 3 important levels:
input, hidden-extract info, output

DIFFERENCE:
machine learning/deep learning
simple data/complex data
not so accurate/accurate
low resources/high resources        low computational power/high computational power
manual feature extraction/automatic
modearte dataset size/huge dataset size

Activation function:
1. Sigmoid function: class 0: if value >0.5, class 1:                   Used for Binary Classification task
2. ReLU function: used in hidden level: if negative x value then it is turned to 0
3. Softout function: output layer, used in multi class Classification
