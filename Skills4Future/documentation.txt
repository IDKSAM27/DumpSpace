Skills4Future Workshop stuff

MACHINE LEARNING:
Supervised: Classification, Regression
Unsupervied: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction


DEEP LEARNING
Neural network/deep learning 3 important levels:
input, hidden-extract info, output

Difference:
machine learning/deep learning
simple data/complex data
not so accurate/accurate
low resources/high resources        low computational power/high computational power
manual feature extraction/automatic
modearte dataset size/huge dataset size

Activation function:
1. Sigmoid function: class 0: if value >0.5, class 1:                   (Used for Binary Classification task)
2. ReLU function: used in hidden level: if negative x value then it is turned to 0
3. Softout function: output layer, used in multi class Classification

COMPUTER VISION

Techniques:
1. Image Classification
2. Object detection
3. Segmentation - semantic and instant segmentation


Architecture of Convolution Neural Network (CNN):
1. Input
2. Convolution - to tranform
3. Pooling - Maxpooling
4. Fully Connected 
5. Output

Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions (or signals) to produce a third function. It is widely used in image processing, signal processing, and deep learning.

Reason for:
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential: where the layers are in sequence(Sequential)

2. Principle
3. Moral values

data bias
algorithm bias
privacy
accountability
